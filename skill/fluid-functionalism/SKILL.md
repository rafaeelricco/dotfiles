  Build React UIs with Fluid Functionalism — a shadcn/ui registry (@fluid) of
  animated components with a shared motion system: three spring speeds, a
  hover highlight that glides to the item nearest the cursor, labels that
  change weight without layout shift. Use whenever the user mentions Fluid
  Functionalism, @fluid, or fluidfunctionalism.com, asks for UI with
  satisfying/fluid/polished motion in a React, Next.js, shadcn, Radix, or
  Base UI project, builds any interface (settings dialogs, sidebars, command
  menus, chat UIs, forms, lists, tables) in a project with @fluid components
  installed, or asks to review/audit existing UI motion against the system.
  Also use before hand-writing animation code (hover highlights, icon swaps,
  weight changes, enter/exit transitions) there, so custom code follows the
  system instead of inventing timings. On first use in a
  project it audits the stack (deps, Radix vs Base UI flavor, MotionConfig,
  Inter opsz axis) and records verdicts in .agents/fluid-functionalism.md
  for later runs.

# Fluid Functionalism

A [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) registry of components where every
transition makes a state change legible: springs instead of durations, one
hover highlight per list that glides to the item nearest the cursor, and
labels that get heavier without moving their neighbours. Components that touch
a primitive ship in two flavors — Radix and Base UI — with the same API.

Docs and live demos: <https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com> — every component
page has a playground and a **Copy prompt** button whose text is a
self-contained brief (install command, usage snippet, props, docs URL).

Three jobs this skill covers:

1. **Know the project** — the first time this skill runs in a project, audit
   the stack and record it (next section). Every later run reads that record
   instead of re-guessing.
2. **Install and compose the components** — pick the right registry item and
   flavor, wire it in, and compose around what's already built in. The
   catalog is [references/components.md](references/components.md); the craft
   for every doc page and top-level block — the exact behaviors, values, and
   reasons baked into them — is [references/craft.md](references/craft.md).
   The catalog maps separately installable parts to the parent section that
   governs them. Reading that section before composing is what separates
   using this library from merely installing it.
3. **Write custom UI that belongs next to them** — when you build something
   the library doesn't ship, follow the motion system so it moves like the
   rest of the app. Read
   [references/custom-motion.md](references/custom-motion.md) before writing
   any animation, hover, or state-change styling by hand.

## First run in a project: the stack audit

Use `.agents/fluid-functionalism.md` as the shared project record for any
coding agent. If only the legacy `.claude/fluid-functionalism.md` exists,
carry its decisions forward as described in the
[audit reference](references/stack-audit.md#the-audit-file).

Check for `.agents/fluid-functionalism.md`. If it exists and `package.json`
hasn't changed since it was written, read it and trust its stable verdicts —
flavor and stack requirements — without re-deriving them; surface any still-
open advice items only when the current task touches what they affect. Treat
its installed-item inventory and stock/customized notes as leads, not current
truth: files can be added or edited without changing `package.json`. Before
every install, verify the target's current files and diff any same-named file;
only pass `--overwrite` when that check shows the targets are still stock. If
the audit doesn't exist (or its stable verdicts are stale), run the audit in
[references/stack-audit.md](references/stack-audit.md) first: it checks the
dependencies FF needs (React 19, Tailwind v4, framer-motion, shadcn wiring),
settles the flavor verdict from what the project already depends on, catches
the two silent quality killers (`MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` missing,
Inter without the `opsz` axis), inventories what's already installed, and
picks the 2–5 UI upgrades that would help most — systems first (motion
tokens, fluid hover, surfaces, sizes), then components — each rated
impact / effort and ranked by impact-per-effort. UI and design system only:
infrastructure findings are recorded as facts, never pitched as
recommendations. Three rules decide how those land, and they are what
separates advice from a lint report:

- **Write each one from the interface**, not from the code that causes it:
  what someone using the product sees now, on which surface, how often they
  are looking at it, and which quality it buys back. The file and the size
  of the fix are the footnote, never the headline.
- **A behavior the app has never had is a question, not a finding.** Fixing
  something the product already does badly is advice you give; introducing a
  new signature motion — fluid hover above all — changes how the whole thing
  feels, so ask before spending a slot on it. Stillness is often deliberate.
- **A blocked install is never a gate on the outcome.** Old Tailwind or React
  blocks the CLI, not the product getting better; every item is reachable by
  hand. Never front a migration the user didn't ask for.

It writes the results to that file so the project remembers.

## One-time project setup

The audit above tells you which of these are already done — skip those.

1. **Add the registry** (or install per-URL, next section):

   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest registry add @fluid
   ```

2. **Pick the flavor once, per project.** The bare name installs the Radix
   flavor; prefix `base/` for Base UI. The audit records the verdict: decide
   by what the project already depends on — `@base-ui/react` in
   `package.json` → use `base/` names everywhere; `@radix-ui/react-*` (or
   nothing yet) → bare names. Never mix flavors in one project —
   dependencies follow the flavor you pick, so a Base UI dialog pulls in the
   Base UI button.

3. **Enable reduced motion at the root.** One line in the app layout, like a
   ThemeProvider:

   ```tsx
   import { MotionConfig } from "framer-motion";

   <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">{/* providers + app */}</MotionConfig>;
   ```

   This makes every framer-motion component honour the OS
   `prefers-reduced-motion` setting: transforms and layout animations drop,
   opacity and colour fades stay (they aid comprehension).

4. **Load Inter with its optical-size axis** if the project uses Inter and
   you want the weight animations to hold width. With `next/font/google`:
   `Inter({ subsets: ["latin"], axes: ["opsz"] })`. Self-hosted: a
   `@font-face` with `font-weight: 100 900` pointing at `InterVariable.ttf`.
   Without the `opsz` axis everything still works — labels just widen
   slightly when they get heavier.

## Installing components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @fluid/button            # Radix flavor
npx shadcn@latest add @fluid/base/button       # Base UI flavor
# URL form (no registry entry needed) - the flavor lives in the path, so a
# base project needs the /base/ segment here too:
npx shadcn@latest add https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/r/button.json       # Radix
npx shadcn@latest add https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/r/base/button.json  # Base UI
```

Dependencies, shared libs (`springs`, `font-weight`, contexts), and hooks
resolve on their own — install the component you want, not its plumbing.

**Pass `--overwrite`** when the project's shadcn files are stock: this
library installs under the same names (`button.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`, …), and
without the flag the CLI asks per file — a non-interactive shell (you) exits
at the first question. But if those files carry local customizations or
colocated stories/tests (the audit records which), `--overwrite` destroys
that work — review or diff instead of a blind pass.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @fluid/dialog --overwrite
```

Prefer a **block** when one matches the ask — `sidebar-app` (complete app
shell), `dialog-sidebar` (settings dialog), `queued-stack` (queued composer
messages) install as one item with every component they use, already composed.

The full catalog — every component, system, and block, with registry names,
flavors, and what each does — is in
[references/components.md](references/components.md). Read it when choosing
what to install; guessing names wastes an install round-trip.

**Presets:** the Sidebar, Card, InputMessage, AskUserQuestions, Dropdown,
Combobox, and CommandMenu playgrounds encode a configuration into a short
code. If the user gives you a preset code or a doc URL with `?preset=`,
install it directly as a composed block:
`npx shadcn@latest add https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/r/preset/<code>.json`.

## Composing with the system

Installed components already follow every rule. The rules matter when you
write UI _around_ them — a custom list, a bespoke card grid, an animated icon
of your own. The recipes and code snippets live in
[references/custom-motion.md](references/custom-motion.md); the shape of the
system:

- **Three spring speeds, tokenised.** `spring.fast` (0.08s) / `spring.moderate`
  (0.16s) / `spring.slow` (0.24s) from `@/lib/springs`. The bigger the thing
  that moves, the slower the spring. Never hand-write a `duration` — import
  the token, and use its paired `.exit` tween for dismissals so exits read
  crisp instead of replaying the entrance backwards.
- **One hover highlight per list.** Any custom list, menu, strip, or grid with
  hover uses `useFluidHover` + `<FluidHoverHighlight />` (install
  `@fluid/use-fluid-hover`) — never a per-row `:hover` background next to
  components whose highlight glides.
- **Weight without reflow.** Text that gets heavier on state
  (selected/active/open) uses the ghost-span pattern with `fontWeights`
  tokens, so the layout never shifts.
- **Icon swaps crossfade in one cell.** Two glyphs mounted in the same grid
  cell, fading with a touch of blur and scale — the slot never resizes.
- **Nested corners are concentric.** When a rounded surface sits close inside
  another, derive `inner radius = max(0, outer radius - inset - border)`; the
  inset is the interior spacing, usually parent padding, and the border is the
  parent's border width. The shipped shape pair (`container` 12/24px → `bg`
  8/20px) is fixed for a 4px total inset. For any other inset use
  `nestedRadius()` from `@/lib/shape-context` rather than reusing the pair. Past
  24px, with asymmetric gaps, or when the inner surface does not reach the
  corner, treat the layers independently and tune by eye.
- **Move with `transform`/`opacity`**, never `top`/`left`/`width`/`height` —
  that keeps motion on the compositor and lets `MotionConfig` reduce it for
  free.
- **Theming is stock shadcn.** The project's existing theme tokens (colors,
  radii, fonts) apply as they are; don't invent parallel tokens. Icons are
  Lucide by default; swap libraries app-wide via `IconProvider` from
  `@/lib/icon-context`, not by editing installed components.

## The last 1%: where the deep craft lives

The references here teach the system; the fine grain of each component —
its exact choreography, edge-case behavior, and the reasons — is also
written down. In order of reach:

- **[references/craft.md](references/craft.md)** — craft for every documented
  system and component plus each top-level block: the built-in behaviors,
  exact values, and the why. The catalog routes separately installable parts
  to their governing parent section. Read that section **before composing
  with, wrapping, extending, or imitating a component** — it keeps composed
  code from fighting behaviors it didn't know existed (the button already
  handles its own press geometry; select already acknowledges a pick for
  300ms; the panel already snaps under a collapsing child).
- **The installed source is the final word.** These components ship with
  their rationale in comments. Before modifying one, read its installed
  file (`components/ui/*`, `hooks/*`, `lib/*`) — never restyle or re-time
  from memory of what the stock shadcn version does.
- **Each doc page's Copy-prompt brief carries the same "Craft" section.**
  When a user pastes one, treat those bullets as constraints, not
  suggestions.

## Gotchas

- **Don't edit installed components to change timing or hover behaviour** —
  wrap or compose instead. Edits are lost on the next `--overwrite` install
  and drift the app away from the system.
- Components built on a flavored one (AskUserQuestions, ColorPicker,
  CommandMenu, InputCopy, InputMessage, and the blocks) also take the `base/`
  prefix. Single-source items (badge, card, table, input-group, chat-message,
  thinking-indicator, the libs and hooks) have one name for both kinds of
  project.
- The registry expects Tailwind CSS v4, React 19, and framer-motion. On older
  stacks, flag the mismatch to the user before installing half a tree.
- If an install fails on a name, check the catalog in
  [references/components.md](references/components.md) — the registry name is
  not always the component's display name (e.g. TabsSubtle → `tabs-subtle`,
  Fluid Hover → `use-fluid-hover`, Motion → `springs`).
- The base flavor lives at the `base/<name>` **path** — `@fluid/base/select`,
  URL `/r/base/select.json`. Names like `<name>-base` are internal build
  names; `/r/<name>-base.json` 404s **by design** (the build moves those
  files into `base/`). A 404 there is not evidence the registry lacks base
  flavors — try the documented `base/<name>` forms before concluding
  anything, and never record "registry is Radix-only" from a guessed URL.
