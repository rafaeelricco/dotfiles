## Methodology & Frameworks

### Three-Tier Analysis Approach

**Tier 1: Portfolio Health Assessment**
Uses `project_health_dashboard.py` to provide comprehensive multi-dimensional scoring:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_health_dashboard.py assets/sample_project_data.json
```

**Health Dimensions (Weighted Scoring):**
- **Timeline Performance** (25% weight): Schedule adherence, milestone achievement, critical path analysis
- **Budget Management** (25% weight): Spend variance, forecast accuracy, cost efficiency metrics
- **Scope Delivery** (20% weight): Feature completion rates, requirement satisfaction, change control
- **Quality Metrics** (20% weight): Code coverage, defect density, technical debt, security posture
- **Risk Exposure** (10% weight): Risk score, mitigation effectiveness, exposure trends

**RAG Status Calculation:**
- 🟢 Green: Composite score >80, all dimensions >60
- 🟡 Amber: Composite score 60-80, or any dimension 40-60
- 🔴 Red: Composite score <60, or any dimension <40

**Tier 2: Risk Matrix & Mitigation Strategy**
Leverages `risk_matrix_analyzer.py` for quantitative risk assessment:

```bash
python3 scripts/risk_matrix_analyzer.py assets/sample_project_data.json
```

**Risk Quantification Process:**
1. **Probability Assessment** (1-5 scale): Historical data, expert judgment, Monte Carlo inputs
2. **Impact Analysis** (1-5 scale): Financial, schedule, quality, and strategic impact vectors
3. **Category Weighting**: Technical (1.2x), Resource (1.1x), Financial (1.4x), Schedule (1.0x)
4. **EMV Calculation**: Risk Score = (Probability × Impact × Category Weight)

**Risk Response Strategies:**
- **Avoid** (>18 score): Eliminate through scope/approach changes
- **Mitigate** (12-18 score): Reduce probability or impact through active intervention
- **Transfer** (8-12 score): Insurance, contracts, partnerships
- **Accept** (<8 score): Monitor with contingency planning

**Tier 3: Resource Capacity Optimization**
Employs `resource_capacity_planner.py` for portfolio resource analysis:

```bash
python3 scripts/resource_capacity_planner.py assets/sample_project_data.json
```

**Capacity Analysis Framework:**
- **Utilization Optimization**: Target 70-85% for sustainable productivity
- **Skill Matching**: Algorithm-based resource allocation to maximize efficiency
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Critical path resource constraints across portfolio
- **Scenario Planning**: What-if analysis for resource reallocation strategies

### Advanced Prioritization Models

**Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) - For Agile Portfolios**
```
WSJF Score = (User Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) ÷ Job Size

Application Context:
- Resource-constrained environments
- Fast-moving competitive landscapes  
- Agile/SAFe methodology adoption
- Clear cost-of-delay quantification available
```

**RICE Framework - For Product Development**
```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

Best for:
- Customer-facing initiatives
- Marketing and growth projects
- When reach metrics are quantifiable
- Data-driven product decisions
```

**ICE Scoring - For Rapid Decision Making**
```  
ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) ÷ 3

Optimal when:
- Quick prioritization needed
- Brainstorming and ideation phases
- Limited analysis time available
- Cross-functional team alignment required
```

**Decision Tree for Model Selection:**
Reference: `references/portfolio-prioritization-models.md`

- **Resource Constrained?** → WSJF
- **Customer Impact Focus?** → RICE
- **Need Speed?** → ICE
- **Multiple Stakeholder Groups?** → MoSCoW
- **Complex Trade-offs?** → Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

### Risk Management Framework

**Quantitative Risk Analysis Process:**
Reference: `references/risk-management-framework.md`

**Step 1: Risk Identification & Classification**
- Technical risks: Architecture, integration, performance
- Resource risks: Availability, skills, retention
- Schedule risks: Dependencies, critical path, external factors
- Financial risks: Budget overruns, currency, economic factors
- Business risks: Market changes, competitive pressure, strategic shifts

**Step 2: Probability/Impact Assessment**
Uses three-point estimation for Monte Carlo simulation:
```
Expected Value = (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6
Standard Deviation = (Pessimistic - Optimistic) ÷ 6
```

**Step 3: Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Calculation**
```
EMV = Σ(Probability × Financial Impact) for all risk scenarios

Risk-Adjusted Budget = Base Budget × (1 + Risk Premium)
Risk Premium = Portfolio Risk Score × Risk Tolerance Factor
```

**Step 4: Portfolio Risk Correlation Analysis**
```
Portfolio Risk = √(Σ Individual Risks² + 2Σ Correlation×Risk1×Risk2)
```

**Risk Appetite Framework:**
- **Conservative**: Risk scores 0-8, 25-30% contingency reserves
- **Moderate**: Risk scores 8-15, 15-20% contingency reserves  
- **Aggressive**: Risk scores 15+, 10-15% contingency reserves

## Stakeholder Mapping & Engagement

### Power/Interest Grid (Mendelow's Matrix)

Uses `stakeholder_mapper.py` to classify stakeholders and generate communication plans:

```bash
python3 scripts/stakeholder_mapper.py stakeholders.json
python3 scripts/stakeholder_mapper.py --demo --format json
```

**Classification Quadrants (threshold at 5/10):**
- **Manage Closely** (High Power, High Interest): Weekly 1:1s, steering committee, proactive escalation
- **Keep Satisfied** (High Power, Low Interest): Monthly executive summary, milestone invites
- **Keep Informed** (Low Power, High Interest): Bi-weekly newsletter, demo invites, dashboards
- **Monitor** (Low Power, Low Interest): Quarterly updates, organizational newsletter

**Blocker Engagement Strategy:**
The tool identifies stakeholders with `attitude: blocker` and generates targeted engagement strategies based on their power level — high-power blockers require urgent 1:1 engagement and potential executive sponsor escalation; low-power blockers need transparency and involvement.

**Integration with OKR Brainstorming:**
Stakeholder mapping feeds directly into OKR alignment — high-power/high-interest stakeholders shape strategic objectives, while their feedback validates Key Results. Cross-reference with `execution/brainstorm-okrs/` for OKR development workflows.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Portfolio health score does not match stakeholder perception | Dimension weights misaligned with organizational priorities, or data inputs incomplete | Recalibrate HEALTH_DIMENSIONS weights with executive sponsors; ensure all 5 dimensions have data |
| Risk matrix shows all risks clustered in medium zone | Probability/impact scoring lacks granularity or team avoids extreme ratings | Facilitate risk calibration workshop; use three-point estimation and reference past incidents |
| Resource capacity planner shows zero gaps despite team complaints | Utilization data does not account for meeting overhead, context-switching, or unplanned work | Verify CAPACITY_FACTORS config; include 15% meeting overhead and 5% context-switching penalty |
| Stakeholder mapper classifies everyone as "Manage Closely" | Power/interest thresholds too low for your organization, or scores inflated | Adjust POWER_THRESHOLD and INTEREST_THRESHOLD (default: 5); use relative ranking within group |
| RAG status oscillates between green and amber weekly | Thresholds set too tight, or data updates cause noise | Widen amber band (e.g., 55-80 instead of 60-80); use rolling 2-week average instead of point-in-time |
| EMV calculations produce unrealistically high risk exposure | Category weights compounding with high probability/impact scores | Review RISK_CATEGORIES weights; cap financial risk weight at 1.4x; validate probability estimates against historical data |
| Executive reports are too long for stakeholder attention span | Report template includes too many detail sections for the audience | Tailor output to audience using the tone guide; executives need 1-page RAG summary, not full dimension breakdown |

## Success Criteria

- Portfolio average health score maintained above 75/100 across all active projects
- On-time delivery rate exceeds 80% (within 10% of planned timeline)
- Budget variance maintained below 5% average across the portfolio
- Risk mitigation effectiveness above 90% (all critical/high risks have active mitigation plans)
- Resource utilization consistently in the 70-85% optimal range
- Stakeholder satisfaction above 8.5/10 as measured by quarterly surveys
- All projects in red RAG status have documented intervention plans within 48 hours

## Scope & Limitations

**In Scope:**
- Multi-project portfolio health assessment with weighted composite scoring
- Quantitative risk analysis using EMV, probability/impact matrices, and category weighting
- Resource capacity planning with utilization optimization and skill-matching
- Stakeholder mapping with Mendelow's Matrix and targeted communication plans
- Executive-level reporting with RAG status dashboards and strategic recommendations

**Out of Scope:**
- Sprint-level team management (see `scrum-master/` skill)
- Product backlog management and feature prioritization (see `execution/prioritization-frameworks/`)
- Agile coaching and team maturity assessment (see `agile-coach/` skill)
- Financial modeling beyond project-level ROI (see `finance/` domain skills)
- Contract negotiation and procurement management

**Important Caveats:**
- Health scores use deterministic formulas, not ML predictions. Calibrate thresholds to your portfolio context.
- Risk EMV calculations assume independent risks. Portfolio risk correlation analysis (Step 4) provides a more accurate combined view but requires cross-project dependency data.
- Resource capacity planning models are weekly snapshots; they do not account for intra-week variability or unplanned work spikes.
